# Swipe & Go 

## Main Idea
A Tinder-like, swipe-based activity recommender app that learns the user's personality and preferences over time. By analyzing factors like location, interests, time of day, and past swipes, the app intelligently suggests activities that align with the user's vibe. 


## Features
* Account-based (user autho API)
* Quick quiz (outgoing, time preference, location, past swipes)
* Collect information from social media, websites, etc, to suggest ideas to the user
* We don't want it to cut out events, but prioritize certain ones over others
* 3 Pages: one for swiping, one for map, list view of the ones you have picked
